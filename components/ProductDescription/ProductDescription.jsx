        Satisfy your cat’s natural instincts to scratch, perch, play, and catnap
        without sacrificing your home décor. The redesigned Jungle Gym Cat Tree
        2.0 is an innovation in modern cat furniture, designed to accentuate and
        elevate your interior décor while providing your cat with a paradise of
        its very own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tested by cats and their owners, our second iteration of this sleek,
        modern cat tree is better than ever with more scratching surfaces,
        lounging areas, and added platforms for easy accessibility - all with
        the same timeless elegance and high-quality wood construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jungle Gym Cat Tree Condo 2.0 is ideal for multi-cat households,
        with five levels that are each designed for ultimate cat comfort and to
        help maintain their physical and mental health.

      <p>
        Your cat can hide away and nap in the windowed cubby, scratch on any of
        the four carpeted platforms, 2 side sisal scratch pads, or two-tier
        sisal scratching post, snooze in the cat hammock or survey their kingdom
        from the top observation platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each perching surface is covered with removable, scratchable felt pads
        for easy cleaning. For cats that naturally seek height, the curved top
        platform promises to be a perfect lounging area – or the kitty hammock
        for cats that want a bit of breathability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sturdy fabric of the hammock is designed to support the shifting
        positions of cats of all sizes while keeping them safe and cozy.
      </p>
      <p>

        affordable cat tree might be just up your alley. Because our Jungle Gym
        Cat Tree Condo is designed not only for your cat's comfort and
