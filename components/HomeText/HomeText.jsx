      <h1>Improve gaming experience!</h1>

      <p>Welcome to the Gamebuff.</p>
      <p>
        Our story began when we saw a gap in the market of new and innovative
        products not being pushed into the market quick enough nor without any
        quality control. Huge brands and corporations are slow and often not
        caring about their customers as they have millions more.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where our idea was born - create a shop with highest quality
        products for our favorite game while providing EXCEPTIONAL customer
        satisfaction level.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have worked really hard to pull this all together simply to satisfy
        you - the end customer. Hopefully you can feel that genuine love for our
        products when purchasing from us!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for showing interest in our shop, and gl hf in your future
        games!
      </p>
      <p>Happy shopping! 🌠</p>
